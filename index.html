            untill then i will showcase some of my coding projects over the years
            and also keep adding software that showcases my coding acheivments
            thoughout college and beyond. I hope you enjoy and have fun with

        <h2>IDE functionality<h2>
      </section>
          <p id="hidden-passage"> An IDE consists of the fundimetal building blocks for any kind of
            coding prosess and really establishes creatiity that is decided by the
            user. IDEs are interactive interpreters that take the code you create
            and in turn create results that we see in everyday computing wheather
            that be loading websites on google to creating interactive social media
            apps on your phone. They also have pre-defined languges that can assist
            you with any project you may come across. With so many IDEs out there
            we understand that ours may not be your first choice but we strive to
            make an IDE that is worth visiting and withstands the test of time.
